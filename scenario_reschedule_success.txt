# --- Transition to Pitch/Booking ---
# Agent should be proposing the deep dive / scheduling now
User: That makes sense. I see why you called.

# Timezone Check
User: I am in Eastern time.

# --- Booking Request (Bad Time) ---
# We ask for "Tuesday at 2pm" which we know returns UNAVAILABLE (offering Sunday slots).
User: Sure, Tuesday at 2pm works for me.

# --- Reschedule Loop ---
# Agent response expectation: "Tuesday at 2pm isn't available... Sunday at X..."
# User proposes a new time. 
User: okay how about tomorrow at 4pm?

# --- Final Confirmation ---
# If "Tomorrow" works, agent will say "Checking... Locked in" (or similar success msg)
# If "Tomorrow" fails, agent will say "Unavailable... Sunday..."
# Either way, verifying this transition logic is the goal.
# User: Great, bye.
User: I see.
