LLM response (2.16s): [S] I totally get that, Kendrick, sales calls can feel pushy sometimes. But this is about building a simple lead generation system with websites that rank on Google and bring in passive income from local businesses, like our student E-pay who hit fifteen thousand a month in just eighteen months. What part of setting up something that runs on autopilot after the initial work sounds intriguing to you?

LLM response (1.79s): [N] Fair enough, Kendrick—I'll keep it tight.
