BUILD VERIFICATION FILE
======================

This file helps verify Netlify is deploying latest code.

Build Date: 2025-11-13
Build Time: 12:30 UTC
Change Made: Removed /api from api.js Line 4
Test Added: Red banner in App.js showing build timestamp

If you can read this file at https://li-ai.org/BUILD_INFO.txt
then Netlify IS deploying from GitHub.

If this file doesn't exist or shows old date,
then Netlify is NOT deploying latest code!

Expected behavior after this deploy:
- Red banner at top of page with current date/time
- Browser console shows: "API baseURL: https://api.li-ai.org" (no /api)
- Network requests go to: /api/settings/api-keys (single /api, not double)
